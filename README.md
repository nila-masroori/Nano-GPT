# NanoGPT Language Model

## Introduction
NanoGPT is a lightweight, efficient language model developed from scratch, designed to understand and generate text based on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. This project demonstrates the capabilities of autoregressive text generation using transformer architectures and explores the nuances of Shakespearean language patterns.

## Features
- Text analysis and generation using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset
- Implementation of self-attention mechanisms and embedding layers
- Utilization of PyTorch for model architecture and training# Nano-GPT
